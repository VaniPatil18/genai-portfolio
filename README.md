# ðŸ§  Autoencoder for Image Compression & Reconstruction

This project demonstrates how an autoencoder learns to compress and reconstruct images. Built and tested in Google Colab.

## ðŸ“Œ Concept

Autoencoders are neural networks trained to copy their input to their output. The architecture includes:
- **Encoder**: compresses the input into a latent representation
- **Decoder**: reconstructs the input from this compressed version

## ðŸ”§ Architecture

```python
Input â†’ Dense â†’ ReLU â†’ Dense (encoding) â†’ Dense â†’ ReLU â†’ Dense â†’ Output
